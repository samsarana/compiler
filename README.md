# compiler
A compiler written in python to compile a program in a rudimentary language to JVM bytecode. The rudimentary language has a grammar that supports basic assignment, arithmetic, if/if-else/while statements and nested Boolean comparisons. See 'examples.txt' for examples of programs in the language that can be compiled.
